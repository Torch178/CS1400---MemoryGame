# CS1400---MemoryGame

A memory game in which an array of randomly selected colors is generated and displayed to the user using a simple GUI (Graphic User Interface) built using the the JFrame and other pre-built Java GUI interface methods. After being shown the colors, the user will then be prompted to enter each individual color in the order they were listed. The user input as well as the success and failure messages are all done using GUI windows. The colors for the game are randomly selected using a random number generator which is mapped to index values in an array of all possible colors (white, black, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, brown).
